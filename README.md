### Hi there ðŸ‘‹


Hello! My name is Jesse. I am currently studying to be a software engineer at Codam Coding College, Amsterdam. Born and raised in Zwolle, I moved to Groningen to study International Business. Eventually I decided to try out for the selection piscine at Codam, where I discovered
my passion for software development. I have been studying at Codam since March, 2020. Iâ€™m currently looking for an internship, so feel free to contact me.
